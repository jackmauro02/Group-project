I have done a lot of things 
1) built Login  works 
2) Fixed UserRegister that works just change the db connection in -
    -LoginForm
    -UserRegister
    -ForgotPasswordForm

also change settings.json 
"database": "comp5590",
"username": "newuser",
"password": ""
these values 

to sign in 
    - Username - jack
    - Password - Liverpool 


- sign out feature works 
- also inactivity so after 2 mins it will sign out
- reset your Password also works 
    -   email - jack@gmail.com
    -   phone - 0123456789


2) things to do 
 -  make the code nicer 
 -  Hash the password
 - make sure the doc file is correct 
 - do the testing

if any problems just message 

 DO NOT TOUCH THE LIBRARY FOLDER
